# OrbitScore Project Rules

## üî¥ CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

### 1. WORK_LOG.md Updates (ÊúÄÈáçË¶Å)
**EVERY commit MUST be documented in WORK_LOG.md**
- Update WORK_LOG.md BEFORE committing
- Document what was changed, why, and the commit hash
- Keep chronological order
- Include technical decisions and challenges

### 2. Documentation First
- Update relevant docs (README, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, etc.) with each change
- Documentation is as important as code
- Keep specifications in sync with implementation

### 3. Test-Driven Development
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Golden files for regression testing

## üìã Development Workflow

### For Each Phase:
1. Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Create todo list
3. Implement features
4. Write/update tests
5. **Update WORK_LOG.md**
6. Update other documentation
7. Commit with descriptive message
8. **Add commit hash to WORK_LOG.md**

### Commit Message Format:
```
<type>: <description>

<detailed explanation>

<what changed>
<why it changed>
<impact>
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, chore

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Degree System Philosophy
- **0 = rest/silence** - Musical value, not just "no sound"
- 1-12 = chromatic scale (C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B)
- This is a defining feature of OrbitScore

### 2. Precision
- Â∞èÊï∞Á¨¨3‰Ωç„Åæ„Åß (3 decimal places)
- Random with seed for reproducibility

### 3. Contract-Based Design
- IR types are frozen contracts
- Breaking changes require new versions

## üìÅ File Structure Rules

### Test Files:
- Location: `tests/<module>/<feature>.spec.ts`
- Naming: descriptive, ends with `.spec.ts`

### Source Files:
- Location: `packages/<package>/src/`
- Exports: Explicit, no default exports

### Documentation:
- WORK_LOG.md - Development history (UPDATE WITH EVERY COMMIT!)
- README.md - User guide
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Technical roadmap
- INSTRUCTIONS_NEW_DSL.md - Language specification
- PROJECT_RULES.md - This file

## üö´ Things to Avoid

1. **NEVER** commit without updating WORK_LOG.md
2. **NEVER** change IR types without version consideration
3. **NEVER** skip tests for new features
4. **NEVER** use magic numbers - use constants
5. **NEVER** leave TODO comments without tracking

## ‚úÖ Checklist Before Committing

- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] WORK_LOG.md updated
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Commit message is descriptive
- [ ] No console.log left in production code
- [ ] Types are properly defined

## üîÑ Continuous Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Run tests frequently during development
2. **Incremental Commits**: Small, focused commits
3. **Documentation Sync**: Keep docs in sync with code
4. **Code Review**: Review your own code before committing

## üìù WORK_LOG.md Structure

Each phase section should include:
- Overview with date
- Work content details  
- Technical decisions
- Challenges and solutions
- File changes
- Test results
- Commit history with hashes
- Next steps

## üéµ Domain-Specific Rules

### Music DSL:
- Degree 0 is sacred - it represents musical silence
- All durations are musical values
- Precision matters for timing

### MIDI:
- Note range: 0-127
- PitchBend range: -8192 to +8191
- Channel 0 is reserved (use 1-15 for MPE)

**Remember**: This project values documentation and history as much as code. Every change tells a story that should be preserved in WORK_LOG.md!
