# Pre-commit hook for OrbitScore
#
# IMPORTANT: This hook runs tests and build before commit.
# This is intentional to catch errors early, even though it makes commits slower.
# 
# Rationale:
# - Prevents pushing broken code that will fail in CI/CD
# - Saves time by catching issues locally instead of waiting for CI/CD feedback
# - Ensures code quality before it reaches the remote repository
#
# If you need to skip this hook temporarily (NOT RECOMMENDED):
# git commit --no-verify

npx lint-staged

# Run tests
npm test || exit 1

# Run build
npm run build || exit 1
