 * MIDI symbolic pitch types — Phase 1 (Issue #228)
 *
 * Spec: docs/specs-v2/PITCH_DSL_SPEC_v1.1.html §2.1, §2.4, §7-0
 *
 * §7-0 (記譜対応の前提): the pipeline MUST preserve symbolic pitch information
 * (degree, alteration, octave shift, resolution context, tie/legato attributes)
 * and resolve to a MIDI note number ONLY at the output adapter's final stage.
 * Propagating resolved note numbers alone is forbidden — note-name spelling
 * (D#/Eb), ties, and slurs are lost irreversibly once numbered, and the future
 * real-time score-rendering epic (#240) depends on this information surviving.
 *
 * This file defines the §7-0 contract. Everything downstream (timing pipeline,
 * MIDI scheduler, output adapter) carries these structures, not bare numbers.
