### 6.15 Multi-Track Synchronization and Final Fixes (January 5, 2025)

**Date**: January 5, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**Work Content**: Resolved final issues with multi-track playback and completed Phase 6

#### Issue 1: Snare Pattern Playback Bug
**Problem**: `snare.play(0, 1, 0, 1)` was heard as `(0, 1, 1, 0)` or distorted pattern  
**Impact**: Multi-track synchronization broken, live performance impossible  
**Root Cause**: `scheduledPlays` array was only sorted once at scheduler initialization. New events added during live coding were appended without re-sorting, causing out-of-order execution  
**Debug Evidence**:
```
Scheduled: snare at 47341ms
Actually played: snare at 47841ms (drift: 500ms) ← Wrong!
```

**Fix**: Added `this.scheduledPlays.sort((a, b) => a.time - b.time)` to `playAudio()` method  
**Result**: ✅ Perfect timing, all sequences play with 0-3ms drift  
**Files**: `packages/engine/src/audio/advanced-player.ts`

#### Issue 2: Auto-Start Scheduler
**Problem**: Calling `sequence.loop()` automatically started scheduler, even after `global.stop()`  
**Impact**: Loss of explicit control over when audio plays  
**Root Cause**: `scheduleEvent()` and `scheduleSliceEvent()` contained auto-start logic  
**Fix**: 
1. Removed auto-start from `scheduleEvent()` and `scheduleSliceEvent()`
2. Added scheduler running checks to `sequence.run()` and `sequence.loop()`
3. Display warning: `⚠️ kick.loop() - scheduler not running. Use global.run() first.`

**Result**: ✅ Users must explicitly call `global.run()` before sequences will play  
**Files**: `packages/engine/src/audio/advanced-player.ts`, `packages/engine/src/core/sequence.ts`

#### Issue 3: Live Sequence Addition Required Restart
**Problem**: Adding new sequences (e.g., hihat) during live coding required engine restart  
**Impact**: Broken live coding workflow, loss of state  
**Root Cause**: `filterDefinitionsOnly()` filtered out ALL `var` declarations during re-evaluation  
**Fix**: Removed `var` declaration filtering - `InterpreterV2` already handles instance reuse  
**Result**: ✅ New sequences can be added by saving file, no restart needed  
**Files**: `packages/vscode-extension/src/extension.ts`

#### Issue 4: hasEvaluatedFile Not Reset
**Problem**: After engine restart, first file save showed `first: false`, causing instance creation errors  
**Impact**: Sequences not instantiated after restart  
**Root Cause**: `hasEvaluatedFile` flag not reset in `startEngine()`, `stopEngine()`, and process exit handler  
**Fix**: Added `hasEvaluatedFile = false` to all engine lifecycle events  
**Result**: ✅ First save after restart correctly initializes all instances  
**Files**: `packages/vscode-extension/src/extension.ts`

#### Final Test Results

**3-Track Synchronization Test** (kick + snare + hihat):
```
🔊 Playing: kick at 178494ms (drift: 1ms)
🔊 Playing: hihat at 178494ms (drift: 1ms)  ← Perfect sync!
🔊 Playing: snare at 178994ms (drift: 1ms)
🔊 Playing: hihat at 178994ms (drift: 1ms)
🔊 Playing: kick at 179493ms (drift: 0ms)
🔊 Playing: hihat at 179493ms (drift: 0ms)
🔊 Playing: snare at 179993ms (drift: 0ms)
🔊 Playing: hihat at 179993ms (drift: 0ms)
```

**Timing Accuracy**:
- Target interval: 500ms
- Actual drift: 0-3ms (0.6% error)
- Parallel playback: Perfect synchronization

**Workflow Verification**:
- ✅ Engine start without `global.run()` → no audio
- ✅ `kick.loop()` without `global.run()` → warning displayed
- ✅ `global.run()` → scheduler starts
- ✅ `kick.loop()` → kick plays
- ✅ `snare.loop()` → snare added, synced with kick
- ✅ Add hihat to file and save → hihat available immediately
- ✅ `hihat.loop()` → hihat added, synced with kick and snare
- ✅ `kick.stop()` → only kick stops, others continue
- ✅ `snare.stop()` → only snare stops, hihat continues
- ✅ `global.stop()` → all stop
- ✅ `kick.loop()` after stop → warning displayed

#### Files Modified

**Engine Core**:
- `packages/engine/src/audio/advanced-player.ts`:
  - Added sort after `playAudio()` for chronological execution

### 6.17 Polymeter Support Implementation (January 5, 2025)

**Objective**: Enable sequences to have independent time signatures (polymeter/polytempo).

**Problem Identified**:
- Bar duration calculation used incorrect formula: `barDuration = (60000 / tempo) * meter.numerator`
- This prevented sequences from having different bar lengths
- `beat(5 by 4)` was incorrectly calculated as 2500ms when it should be based on numerator and denominator

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Corrected Bar Duration Formula**:
   - Old: `barDuration = beatDuration * meter.numerator` (wrong)
   - New: `barDuration = quarterNoteDuration * (meter.numerator / meter.denominator * 4)` (correct)
   
2. **Applied to Multiple Locations**:
   - `play()` method - for initial timing calculation
   - `getPatternDuration()` - for loop duration calculation

**Mathematical Examples** (BPM 120 = 500ms quarter note):
- `4 by 4`: 500 * (4/4 * 4) = 2000ms ✅
- `5 by 4`: 500 * (5/4 * 4) = 2500ms ✅
- `9 by 8`: 500 * (9/8 * 4) = 2250ms ✅

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Polymeter test: `kick.beat(4 by 4)` + `snare.beat(5 by 4)`
- ✅ Kick: 1000ms intervals (2000ms bar / 2 triggers)
- ✅ Snare: 1250ms intervals (2500ms bar / 2 triggers)
- ✅ Synchronization at 10000ms (20 beats = LCM of 4 and 5)
- ✅ Drift: 0-5ms (excellent accuracy)

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/engine/src/core/sequence.ts` - Fixed `play()` and `getPatternDuration()`
- `packages/engine/src/audio/advanced-player.ts` - Added debug logging
- `examples/multi-track-test.osc` - Updated for polymeter testing
- `test-assets/audio/hihat.wav` - Created combined hihat file (closed + open)

**Debug Enhancements**:
- Added playback timing logs: `🔊 Playing: {sequence} at {time}ms (scheduled: {scheduled}ms, drift: {drift}ms)`
- Helps verify precise timing and identify timing issues

**Key Insight**:
- `beat()` defines **bar duration**, not trigger count
- `play()` arguments define **trigger count and timing**
- This separation enables polymeter while keeping `play()` simple

**Commit**: (pending) `feat: add polymeter support with correct bar duration calculation`
